## What is CodeWars?

Codewars is a website that gives you programming challenges in the language you like to use. It has a system to track

## Don't be a copycat!

If you are going to try to tackle the same challenges, be fair and don't copy.
I'm sure there's a system that prevents you from doing it and you would get
caught inmediately, so please, don't even think about it.
